# Vanilla Framework

**Not a framework, but a frame to work with.**

Vanilla is a lightweight, modular, and dynamic framework designed to prioritize simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. It empowers developers to build robust web applications with a clear distinction between **Pages**, **Modules**, and **Components**.

With its intuitive structure, comprehensive Navigation service acting as a dual-layered router, and a suite of dynamic features, Vanilla provides the perfect balance between minimalism and functionality.

At its core, Vanilla strives for efficiency and reusability, enabling developers to **code once** and deploy seamlessly across the application.

Whether youâ€™re starting small or scaling big, Vanilla is your trusted frame to work with.

**Vanilla, why code more then once?**
